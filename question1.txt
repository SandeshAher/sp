Requirements & Goals
Global and fast deployment.
System takes the code, converts into binary and deploys the code globally.
System should save the historical data of all the builds and the deployments.

Capacity Estimation and Constraints
System should be extreamly fast with a cap of 30mins for the entire deployment.
Due to large codebase binaries can take upto 10GB storage.
The system is used extensively and can have 1000 deployments/day.

High Level System Design
We can think of this system to be consisting 2 parts at a high level:
Building the binary
Deploying the binary
